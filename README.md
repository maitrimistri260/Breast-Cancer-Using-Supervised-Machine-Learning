# Breast-Cancer-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning
Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. If it is not identified in the earlystage then the result will be the death of the patient. Worldwide near about 12% of women affected by breast cancer and the number is still increasing.
Breast cancer is one of the most dangerous and common reproductive cancers that affect mostly women. The oldest documented cases of breast cancer were in Egypt in 3000 BC. 
Breast tumor is an abnormal growth of tissues in the breast, and it may be felt as a lump or nipple discharge or change of skin texture around the nipple region. Cancers are abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and are able to invade other tissues. Cancer cells have the ability to spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymphatic systems. It is the leading cause of death among middle aged and older women. According to cancer statistics, breast cancer is the second most common and the leading cause of cancer deaths among women, second only to lung cancer. Around 1 in 36 (3%) women dies due to breast cancer. It has become a major health issue in the past 50 years, and its incidence has increased in recent years; in Malaysia, breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer among women. It has an incidence rate of about 26% (more than 4400 women) among cancer affecting women. Around 40% of the women who suffered from breast cancer in Malaysia have died (IARC). Hence, determining the right decision from a right diagnosis is crucial
So to tackle this problem , ML plays a very important role. ML algorithms helps to determine cells whether Malignant or Benign. ML algorithms can determine cancer cells more 
efficiently.
### The algorithms that are trained and tested are:
1. Super Vector Classifier
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neigbour
4. Na√Øve Bayes
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. AdaBoost
8. XGBoost

After training all algorithms, the assessment shows that Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers are giving high accuracy than remaining but we choose XGBoost.
Therefore, in conclusion the evaluation shows that XGBoost Classifier can detect The Breast Cancer with approximately 98% accuracy.
Hence Machine Learning Models are very useful in the field of Medical Science
